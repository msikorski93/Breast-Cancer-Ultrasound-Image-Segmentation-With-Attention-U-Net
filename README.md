This notebook was developed to perform an image segmentation problem on breast ultrasound images. An image analysis method based on Attention U-Net network was proposed. The U-Net network model is improved by introducing attention gates to upgrade the ability to obtain the feature information of sonograms and detect tumor structures within the tissue. The experimental results show that the proposed model can perform the segmentation and determine cancer within ultrasound images. The success of this method proves deep learning to be reliable as medical diagnosis assistance for physicians.
